		<h1>Animals</h1>
		<section>
		<p>There are a lot of different kind of animals that I like! Such as:<br>
		<ul><li>Elephants</li><br>
		<li>Spiders</li><br>
		<li>Frogs</li><br><br></ul>

		Frogs are great because have you ever met a <span style="color:green">frog</span> that wasn't cute?
		</section>
		<section>
		Elephants are great too because <span style="color:gray">baby elephants</span> are like very intelligent dogs with a prehensile nose.

		Spiders are a tough one to like, but I have a tarantula of my own, so it's hard not to like her! I feed her at 6&nbsp;pm every week.</section>
